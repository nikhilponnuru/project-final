<p>Question: What factors can reduce Face API’s accuracy for Recognition, Verification, or Find Similar?

Answer: Generally it is the same cases where humans have difficulty identifying someone including;

    Obstructions blocking one or both eyes
    Harsh lighting, e.g. severe backlighting
    Changes to hair style or facial hair
    Changes due to age
    Extreme facial expressions (e.g. screaming)

Face API is often successful in challenging cases like these, but accuracy can be reduced. To make recognition more robust and address these challenges, train your Persons with photos that include a diversity of angles and lighting.

Question: I am passing the binary image data in but I get an "Invalid face image" error.

Answer: This implies that the algorithm had an issue parsing the image. Causes include:

    The supported input image formats includes JPEG, PNG, GIF(the first frame), BMP.
    Image file size should be no larger than 4MB
    The detectable face size range is 36x36 to 4096x4096 pixels. Faces out of this range will not be detected
    Some faces may not be detected due to technical challenges, e.g. very large face angles (head-pose), large occlusion. Frontal and near-frontal faces have the best results
