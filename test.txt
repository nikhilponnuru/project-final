As a computer science undergraduate in India I respect Russians a lot.

They are awesome coders. I know Russians start learning programming at a very young age and are much ahead than the rest of the world (especially India). Every year they perform brilliantly at the ACM ICPC Programming Contest.
They are awesome Hackers. Russian crackers are the first one to crack every game. The Americans will develop a game in years and Russians will crack it in a day !
They are awesome mathematicians. And they are good with Physics too. Almost all engineers in India have referred to the books authored by Russians at some point of time.


Scientists will be forced to do real research, benchmarked globally.
Universities and Colleges will have to really teach and make kids employable.
Government servants will actually have to serve, not rule.
Skill development companies will actually develop skills usable in real world.
Taxes will actually be paid, collected and managed without fear, favour or bribes.
Entrepreneurs will finally get some respect.
The wanton lust for ministerial posts will literally vanish. It will become difficult to find ministerial candidates!
Judiciary will start delivering quick results.
All traditionally privileged self-regulating powerful professions (CA, CS, Lawyers) will discover what true neutral regulation is.
Teachers will actually report in time. To teach. Or lose pay.
Government hospitals will actually treat and cure poor patients free.
Medicines will actually come within the reach of everyone.
Pakistan will rue the day it decided to become a permanent foe of India.
Every single rupee earned and spent by governments will be on a transparent updating internet dashboard.
Elections will be through mobiles. Over in 30 minutes.
In short, an extremely implausible scenario as we Indians are so accustomed to never being held accountable, we will fiercely resist most of this. Our tragedy is us, not any foreign force.
